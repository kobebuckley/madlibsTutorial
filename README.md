End Goal: Madlibs Project 
--------------------------

A word game that prompts a user for words that will be inserted into a story. The user will not know the story until all the words are entered into the prompt. 

For example, the computer could ask for a 2 nouns, 1 adjective, and 4 verbs that end with ing.

*Question Driven Development Section Examples*

How to create a Python Project? 

How to ask the user for words? 

How to generate random stories? 

How to insert the user written words into the stories? 

How to make the story appear to the user at the end

Do we need a Front end ( HTML & CSS ) for this or do we keep this at just a terminal? 

-----------------------------------------------------------

*Resources*
--------------------------

Mostly just google based on questions (not likely good to focus too much on AI at a beginner stage)

*NLP: Parts of Speech (POS)*
--------------------------

First we install NLTK
